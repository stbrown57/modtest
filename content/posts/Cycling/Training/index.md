I've tried Xert and SystemX, both were OK, but I wanted to get a base level using the free tools that are available. All training efforts are recored on Garmin Connect and Strava by default, and I can't see this changing. I started with Garmin's "Training Plans"

Garmin's static training plan was used in preparation of the 2023 Cannonball centruy. I inital increases during the base stage, but stagnated during the build phase.  There were performace test in the plan, but it looks like FTP actually decliened during the period. I am keeping this cheap to at a mimium set a base level for any plan or system I may feel will help improve my performance. 

Strava has a number of "plans" based on Carmichael training system, it is not automatically added to the Garmin calendar seems to work by emailing a workout. This may have to be converted into "workouts" in garmin for both recording the progress and riding the workout on the Garmin 530. I will start the "Intermediate Indoor Training Plan" on the 9th of October.
